# Brightness Temperature at Channel 2

This is a composite based on the *JPSS-1 ATMS Level 1B Brightness Temperature V2 (SNDRJ1ATMSL1B)*[1].

Calibrated temperature values from channel 2 are used.

### Appearance

The temperature range displayed starts at 140K (-133.15 °C) and ends at 300K (26.85 °C).

The lower the temperature is, the colder the color will be, and, the higher the temperature, the warmer the color will be.
